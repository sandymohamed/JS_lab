/*
#### Variables:
 ## A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. 
 Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

## Declaring a variable means giving it a name.

Example Code
let hello;

 ### Variable naming follows specific rules: 
names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

--> declare variable name;
## Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon ;


## Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.
let hello = "Hello";

*/


/*

### Strings:

## In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

--> Assign variable name with your name;

## The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using console.log()
--> print variable name in the console;

## When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. 
### Note that when reassigning a variable, you do not use the let keyword again.
--> reassign variable name ;

Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, 
but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case:

Example Code:
*/

let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
let yetAnotherVariable;
let thisIsAVeryLongName;
// --> use camel case to declare new variable name 

/*
When you declare a variable without initializing it, it is considered uninitialized.
Currently, your newVariableName variable is uninitialized.

Add a console.log() to see what the value of your newVariableName variable is. "undefiend"

The default value of an uninitialized variable is undefined.
This is a special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.

--> Assign the string "Test" to your newVariableName variable below your declaration. Open the console to see how your log has changed.

*/

// Use let to declare a count variable. Assign it the number 8. When using a number value, you do not use quotes. For example:
// Example Code
let money = 100;



/*
#### const 
In JavaScript, you can declare a variable with the const keyword. This means that the variable cannot be  
reassigned (or changed) after it is declared. This is useful for values that should not be
changed.


First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:

Example Code
const firstName = "Naomi";
firstName = "Jessica";
A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:
const firstName;


--> Replace let keywords in previous examples with const.
*/


// ####	Operations
// -- > you can perform mathematical operations, like addition. Try printing count + 1 to the console.

// You can also perform subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
// --> try each of them in console

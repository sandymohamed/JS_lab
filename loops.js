#### loops
To generate a pyramid, you will need to create multiple rows.
 When you have to perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met, you will use a loop. There are many ways to write a loop.

You are going to start with a basic for loop. for loops use the following syntax:
for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}

you will use the less than operator (<). This allows you to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
